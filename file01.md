## Most Verbs

Most verbs conjugate like the verb "run" below. Notice how you add an "s" to third-person forms. Third-person negative forms and third-person questions are made using "does."

| Positive      | Negative              | Question              |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| I **run**.    | I **do not run**.     | **Do** I **run**?     |
| You **run**.  | You **do not run**.   | **Do** you **run**?   |
| We **run**.   | We **do not run**.    | **Do** we **run**?    |
| They **run**. | They **do not run**.  | **Do** they **run**?  |
| He **runs**.  | He **does not run**.  | **Does** he **run**?  |
| She **runs**. | She **does not run**. | **Does** she **run**? |
| It **runs**.  | It **does not run**.  | **Does** it **run**?  |

Instead of "s," "es" is added to positive, third-person forms of verbs ending with the following **sounds**: s, z, sh, ch, j or zs (as in Zsa Zsa). These special "es"-forms have been marked below with an asterisk\*.

| Positive              | Negative               | Question               |
