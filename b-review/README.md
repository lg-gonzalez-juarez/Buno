## Simple Past

## Most Verbs

Most verbs conjugate by adding _-ed_ like the verb "wait" below.

| Positive         | Negative               | Question               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| I **waited**.    | I **did not wait**.    | **Did** I **wait**?    |
| You **waited**.  | You **did not wait**.  | **Did** you **wait**?  |
| We **waited**.   | We **did not wait**.   | **Did** we **wait**?   |
| They **waited**. | They **did not wait**. | **Did** they **wait**? |
| He **waited**.   | He **did not wait**.   | **Did** he **wait**?   |
| She **waited**.  | She **did not wait**.  | **Did** she **wait**?  |
| It **waited**.   | It **did not wait**.   | **Did** it **wait**?   |

## Irregular Verbs

Many verbs, such as "have," take irregular forms in the Simple Past. Notice that you only use the irregular verbs in statements. In negative forms and questions, "did" indicates Simple Past.

| Positive      | Negative               | Question               |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| I **had**.    | I **did not have**.    | **Did** I **have**?    |
| You **had**.  | You **did not have**.  | **Did** you **have**?  |
| We **had**.   | We **did not have**.   | **Did** we **have**?   |
| They **had**. | They **did not have**. | **Did** they **have**? |
| He **had**.   | He **did not have**.   | **Did** he **have**?   |
| She **had**.  | She **did not have**.  | **Did** she **have**?  |
| It **had**.   | It **did not have**.   | **Did** it **have**?   |

## To Be

The verb "be" is also irregular in the Simple Past. Unlike other irregular verbs, there are two Simple Past forms: "was" and "were." It also has different question forms and negative forms. Always remember that you DO NOT use "did" with the verb "be" in the Simple Past.

| Positive       | Negative           | Question       |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| I **was**.     | I **was not**.     | **Was** I?     |
| You **were**.  | You **were not**.  | **Were** you?  |
| We **were**.   | We **were not**.   | **Were** we?   |
| They **were**. | They **were not**. | **Were** they? |
| He **was**.    | He **was not**.    | **Was** he?    |
| She **was**.   | She **was not**.   | **Was** she?   |
| It **was**.    | It **was not**.    | **Was** it?    |

## Modal Verbs

Modal verbs behave very strangely in the Simple Past. The most important verb to remember is "must." Notice how it becomes "had to" in the Simple Past.

"Must" becomes "had to":

* I **must** call my wife now.
* I **had to** call my wife yesterday.
