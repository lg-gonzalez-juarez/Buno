Future Perfect has two different forms: "will have done" and "be going to have done." Unlike [Simple Future](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplefuture.html) forms, Future Perfect forms are usually interchangeable.

## FORM Future Perfect with "Will" \[will have + past participle]

Examples:

* You **will have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.
* **Will** you **have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.?
* You **will not have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.

## FORM Future Perfect with "Be Going To" \[am/is/are + going to have + past participle]

Examples:

* You **are going to have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.
* **Are** you **going to have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.?
* You **are not going to have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.

NOTE: It is possible to use either "will" or "be going to" to create the Future Perfect with little or no difference in meaning.

## USE 1 Completed Action Before Something in the Future

The Future Perfect expresses the idea that something will occur before another action in the future. It can also show that something will happen before a specific time in the future.

Examples:

* By next November, I **will have received** my promotion.
* By the time he _gets_ home, she **is going to have cleaned** the entire house.
* I **am not going to have finished** this test by 3 o'clock.
* **Will** she **have learned** enough Chinese to communicate before she _moves_ to Beijing?
* Sam **is** probably **going to have completed** the proposal by the time he _leaves_ this afternoon.
* By the time I _finish_ this course, I **will have taken** ten tests.
* How many countries **are** you **going to have visited** by the time you _turn_ 50?

Notice in the examples above that the reference points (_marked in italics_) are in [Simple Present](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplepresent.html) rather than [Simple Future](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplefuture.html). This is because the interruptions are in [time clauses](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplefuture.html#tc), and you cannot use future tenses in time clauses.

## USE 2 Duration Before Something in the Future (Non-Continuous Verbs)

With [Non-Continuous Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) and some non-continuous uses of [Mixed Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html), we use the Future Perfect to show that something will continue up until another action in the future.

Examples:

* I **will have been** in London for six months by the time I leave.
* By Monday, Susan **is going to have had** my book for a week.

Although the above use of Future Perfect is normally limited to Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, the words "live," "work," "teach," and "study" are sometimes used in this way even though they are NOT Non-Continuous Verbs.

## REMEMBER No Future in Time Clauses

Like all future forms, the Future Perfect cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when, while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of Future Perfect, [Present Perfect](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/presentperfect.html) is used.

Examples:

* I am going to see a movie when I **will have finished** my homework. _Not Correct_
* I am going to see a movie when I **have finished** my homework._Correct_

## ADVERB PLACEMENT

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You will **only** have learned a few words.
* Will you **only** have learned a few words?
* You are **only** going to have learned a few words.
* Are you **only** going to have learned a few words?

## ACTIVE / PASSIVE

Examples:

* They **will have completed** the project before the deadline. _Active_
* The project **will have been completed** before the deadline._Passive_
* They **are going to have completed** the project before the deadline._Active_
* The project **is going to have been completed** before the deadline. _Passive_
