# Past Simple Regular

We often add **-ed** to verbs (regular verbs) to make the past simple.

* _We often watch a film on Saturday._ ⇒ _We **watched** a film last Saturday._
* _I live in Barcelona._ ⇒ _I **lived** in Barcelona in the 90s._

**When do we double the consonant?**

&#x20;\
We double the consonant when the verb ends in **consonant + vowel + consonant**. This is always true when the verb is **one syllable**.

* stop ⇒ sto**pp**ed, plan ⇒ pla**nn**ed, shop ⇒ sho**pp**ed, rob ⇒ ro**bb**ed.

When the verb is **two syllables**, we only double the consonant when the **STRESS** is **in the last syllable**.

* reFER ⇒ referred, preFER ⇒ preferred, reGRET ⇒ regretted

But we do **NOT double** the consonant when the **STRESS** is **NOT in the last syllable**.

* VIsit ⇒ visited, ANswer ⇒ answered.
